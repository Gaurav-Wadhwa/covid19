# COVID-19 Trend Analysis Project

## Problem Statement:

The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize the trends of COVID-19, focusing on the impact, rate of infection, and recovery. Additionally, the project aims to make predictions about the number of cases expected in the future based on current trends.

## Dataset:

The project utilizes CSV and Excel files containing data about the number of COVID-19 confirmed deaths and recovered patients, both globally and specifically in India.

## Guidelines:

### 1. Data Accumulation using Pandas:

- Use the pandas library to accumulate data from multiple data files.
- Merge and preprocess the data to create a consolidated dataset for analysis.

### 2. Visualization with Plotly:

- Utilize the Plotly library to create interactive visualizations.
- Visualize the impact of COVID-19 globally and specifically in India.
- Analyze the trends in the rate of infection and recovery.

### 3. Time Series Modeling with Facebook Prophet:

- Use the Facebook Prophet library to build time series models.
- Create models to predict the number of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries based on historical data.
- Evaluate the accuracy of the models.

### 4. Visualization of Predictions:

- Combine the accumulated data, visualizations, and predictions.
- Create interactive visualizations that showcase the predictions for the future based on the time series models.

## Project Flow:

1. **Data Accumulation:**
   - Use pandas to load and merge data from multiple sources.
   - Preprocess and clean the data for analysis.

2. **Global and India Trend Visualization:**
   - Use Plotly to create visualizations depicting the trends of COVID-19 globally and in India.
   - Explore the impact, rate of infection, and recovery over time.

3. **Time Series Modeling:**
   - Implement time series models using Facebook Prophet.
   - Train models on historical data for cases, deaths, and recoveries.

4. **Prediction Visualization:**
   - Visualize the predictions generated by the time series models.
   - Display the expected number of cases, deaths, and recoveries in the future.

## Deliverables:

- Python codebase containing data accumulation, visualization, and time series modeling.
- Consolidated dataset for analysis.
- Interactive visualizations depicting COVID-19 trends.
- Time series models predicting future COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries.
- Documentation summarizing key insights and findings.

This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 trends, leveraging data accumulation, interactive visualizations, and predictive modeling to aid in understanding and planning for the ongoing pandemic.
